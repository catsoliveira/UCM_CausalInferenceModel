# UCM_CausalInferenceModel
We propose a criterion to address the cause-effect problem with categorical variables (living in sets with no meaningful order), inspired by seeing a conditional probability mass function (pmf) as a discrete memoryless channel. We select as the most likely causal direction the one which the conditional pmf is closer to a uniform channel (UC).
